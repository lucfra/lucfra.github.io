Welcome, dear visitor! 

This is a small website to keep track of things related to my activity; 
you know... just for convenience :) [^1]

Now I work as an applied scientist on explainability and discrete structure learning
at Amazon Web Services in Berlin.
Before joining AWS, I was a Postdoc at University College London
in the [NLP group](https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) -- short but great experience! -- and
before that a research associate working with John Shawe-Taylor on algorithmic fairness. 
I did my [Ph.D.](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10129910/1/Thesis_Luca_Franceschi_UCL.pdf) at UCL, jointly working at the Italian Institute of Technology 
in Genova on Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. [^2]

During these years, I had the luck of having Massimiliano Pontil as supervisor, 
as well as working together with so many amazing researchers and colleagues.

For those who wonder, the portrait is a result of the neural activity of my lovely wife 
Hanui Kim, who's _not_ an LLM (yet).

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

[^1]: ... and also because time ago I solemnly decided not to use Twitter and the likes. I'll keep to that, despite the increasing evidence of the importance of having a good [Kardashian index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashian_Index) in research and the consequent lurking FOMO.
[^2]: The thesis is that long _only_ because I wrote it during full lockdown times; I swear.
